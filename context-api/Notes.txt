------------------------ We need 1 folder and 3 files. ---------------------------

----store file || State definition file || custom hook file for direct access-----


1. create a store folder.

2. define initial state for context

3. create a context with createContext() and export it.

4. create a file for providing definition to our initial state

5. define states and functions for our context with help of useState and functions and export them in a object.

6.  create a wrapper component that will wrap our app and receive props.

7. inside this wrapper component get all the custom defintion of our initial state.

8. inside the wrapper component return a component that will wrap the props.children and give it a prop of value and pass the custom definition to it.

9. in the index.js file wrap the App component with our custom wrapper component.

10. Now create a custom hook component that will help us in accessing the context.

11 inside this custom hook component import the context we created earlier also import useContext.

12. pass this context to useContext and assign it to a variable.

13. return this variable from this component.

14. to access the context in any component we can use this helper custom hook.
